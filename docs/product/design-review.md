# Design Review Workflow

Purpose
- Provide a clear loop for customers to approve or request changes to designs.

Artifacts
- Design files (source and preview)
- Proof or mockup images
- Customer feedback notes

Design review states
- draft: initial concept or update is being prepared
- in-review: customer review requested
- changes-requested: customer asked for revisions
- approved: customer approved final design

Workflow
1) Designer uploads a draft and submits for review.
2) Customer reviews and either approves or requests changes.
3) If changes are requested, status returns to draft.
4) Once approved, order moves to production.

Feedback model
- Required fields: comment, change requests, timestamp, author
- Optional: attachment or annotation image

Policy (TBD)
- Revision limits
- Turnaround time targets
