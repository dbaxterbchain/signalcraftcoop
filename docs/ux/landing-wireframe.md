# Landing Page Wireframe (Spec)

This is a low-fidelity structure for the Signalcraft Coop landing page.

## Goal
- Communicate what we do quickly
- Show the custom + NFC value prop
- Move users to “Start a custom order” or “Browse the store”

## Sections

1) Hero
- Headline: clear, bold, benefit-driven
- Subhead: who it is for + NFC differentiation
- Primary CTA: Start a custom order
- Secondary CTA: Browse standard products
- Visual: gradient background + product mockup card

2) Trust / Use cases
- 3 to 4 cards
- Examples: coffee shop cookie vendor, artist merch table, co-op retail shelf

3) Product capabilities
- Grid of offerings: screen print, embroidery, laser engraving, NFC merch, custom displays
- Each card with short “why it matters” line

4) How it works
- 3 steps: Submit ? Design ? Approve + Produce
- Include design review loop and order status tracking

5) Featured NFC story
- Short case example (1 paragraph) + icon/illustration
- CTA: “Talk through a concept”

6) Store preview
- 4 product tiles (standard products)
- CTA: Browse store

7) Footer
- Contact info, social, small nav
- Secondary CTA: Start custom order

## Notes
- Keep the hero clean; avoid heavy imagery on mobile.
- Use high-contrast CTA buttons.
- Add a small “co-op values” line in the footer.
